## Documentation

The [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-go.html) provides in-depth guidance on using the AWS X-Ray service and the AWS X-Ray SDK for Go.

## Quick Start

**Configuration**

```go
package main

import (
  "context"

  "github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go/xray"

  // Importing the plugins enables collection of AWS resource information at runtime
  _ "github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go/plugins/ec2"
  _ "github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go/plugins/beanstalk"
  _ "github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go/plugins/ecs"
)

func init() {
  xray.Configure(xray.Config{
    DaemonAddr:       "127.0.0.1:2000", // default
    LogLevel:         "info",           // default
    ServiceVersion:   "1.2.3",
  })
}
```

**Capture**

```go
func criticalSection(ctx context.Context) {
  // this example traces a critical code path using a custom subsegment
  xray.Capture(ctx, "MyService.criticalSection", func(ctx1 context.Context) error {
    var err error

    section.Lock()
    result := someLockedResource.Go()
    section.Unlock()

    xray.AddMetadata(ctx1, "ResourceResult", result)
  })
}
```

**HTTP Handler**

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	
	"github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go/xray"
)


func myHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("Hello!"))
}

func main() {
	tracedHandler := xray.Handler(xray.NewFixedSegmentNamer("myApp"), http.HandlerFunc(myHandler))

    http.Handle("/", tracedHandler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil)
}
```

**HTTP Client**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"io/ioutil"
	
	"github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go/xray"
	"golang.org/x/net/context/ctxhttp"
)

func getExample(ctx context.Context) ([]byte, error) {
    resp, err := ctxhttp.Get(ctx, xray.Client(nil), "https://aws.amazon.com/")
    if err != nil {
      return nil, err
    }
    return ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
}
```

**AWS**

```go
sess := session.Must(session.NewSession())
dynamo := dynamodb.New(sess)
xray.AWS(dynamo.Client)
dynamo.ListTablesWithContext(ctx, &dynamodb.ListTablesInput{})
```

**SQL**

Any `db/sql` calls can be traced with XRay by replacing the `sql.Open` call with `xray.SQL`. It is recommended to use URLs instead of configuration strings if possible.

```go
func main() {
  db := xray.SQL("postgres", "postgres://user:password@host:port/db")
  row, _ := db.QueryRow("SELECT 1") // Use as normal
}
```
